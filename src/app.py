                - Lunges: Target the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes while also engaging the core.
                - Calf Raises: Focus on the calves and help improve lower leg strength and stability.

             2. Moderate Duration (20-30 minutes):
                - Step-Ups: Engage the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calf muscles to improve leg strength and power.
